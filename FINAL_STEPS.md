# ðŸŽ‰ SMTP Connection Successful - Final Steps

## Your SMTP test passed! Now finish the setup:

### Step 1: Stop Your Running Application

In the terminal where your app is running, press:
```
Ctrl + C
```

Wait for it to fully stop.

### Step 2: Verify .env Has New Password

Make sure your `.env` file has the NEW password that worked in the test:

```env
EMAIL_HOST=buddydesk.in
EMAIL_PORT=465
EMAIL_SECURE=true
EMAIL_USER=no-reply@buddydesk.in
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_new_password_that_worked
```

### Step 3: Start the Application

```bash
npm start
```

### Step 4: Test Forgot Password

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/user/forgot-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"email\":\"bandhiya.ajay@gmail.com\"}"
```

## Expected Success:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "OTP has been sent to your email address. Please check your inbox.",
  "data": {
    "email": "bandhiya.ajay@gmail.com",
    "expires_in_minutes": 10
  }
}
```

And you should receive the OTP email! ðŸ“§

## If It Still Fails:

1. Double-check .env password matches what worked in test
2. Make sure you fully stopped the old app (Ctrl+C)
3. Check no other instance is running on the same port
4. Clear Node.js cache: `npm cache clean --force`
5. Restart: `npm start`

## Success Indicators:

In your application logs, you should see:
```
âœ… Email service is ready to send messages
âœ… Email sent successfully
```

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! Your forgot password with email OTP is ready!
