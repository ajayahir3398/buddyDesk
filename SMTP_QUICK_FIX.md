# üö® SMTP Authentication Error - Quick Fix

## The Error You're Seeing

```
Error sending email: Invalid login: 535 Incorrect authentication data
```

---

## ‚ö° Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Run the Test Script

I've created a diagnostic tool for you. Run this:

```bash
node test-smtp-connection.js
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Test multiple SMTP configurations automatically
- ‚úÖ Show you which settings work
- ‚úÖ Provide specific error messages
- ‚úÖ Give you the exact settings to use

---

### Step 2: Check Your `.env` File

Make sure your `.env` has these settings:

```env
EMAIL_HOST=buddydesk.in
EMAIL_PORT=465
EMAIL_SECURE=true
EMAIL_USER=no-reply@buddydesk.in
EMAIL_PASSWORD=qjWQu!=rSw
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** 
- If password has special characters, try wrapping in quotes: `EMAIL_PASSWORD="qjWQu!=rSw"`
- Or try without special characters

---

### Step 3: Try Port 587 Instead

If port 465 doesn't work, try:

```env
EMAIL_HOST=buddydesk.in
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
```

Then restart your app:
```bash
npm start
```

---

### Step 4: Verify in cPanel

1. **Log into cPanel:**
   - Go to: `https://buddydesk.in:2083`

2. **Check Email Accounts:**
   - Find `no-reply@buddydesk.in`
   - Verify it exists and is active

3. **Try resetting the password:**
   - Reset the password
   - Update `.env` with new password
   - Restart the application

---

### Step 5: Test Manual Login

Try logging into webmail:
- URL: `https://webmail.buddydesk.in` or `https://buddydesk.in:2096`
- Username: `no-reply@buddydesk.in`
- Password: `qjWQu!=rSw`

**If this fails** ‚Üí Password is wrong, reset it in cPanel

**If this works** ‚Üí SMTP might not be enabled, or port is blocked
